		<p>Weather is the state of the atmosphere, to the degree that it is hot or cold, wet or dry, calm or stormy, clear or cloudy.[1] Weather, seen from an anthropological perspective, is something all humans in the world constantly experience through their senses, at least while being outside.</p>
		
		<h2 id="cloudy">cloudy</h2>
		
		<p>There are socially and scientifically constructed understandings of what weather is, what makes it change, what effects it has on humans in different situations etc.[2] Therefore weather is something people often communicate about. Turning back to the meteorological perspective, most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere,[3][4] just below the stratosphere. </p>
		

		<h2 id="rainy">Rainy</h2>
		
		<p>Weather generally refers to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the statistics of atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.[5] When used without qualification, "weather", is generally understood to mean the weather of Earth.</p>
